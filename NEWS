Changes in new version

Version rPAex 1.0.2 (August 20, 2022)
-------------------------------------------
- New EUsPoint() function:  Generates the matrix Q (Coordinates of the vertices of a particular experimental unit)
- Remove of the externalPoint() function,
- Modification of arguments in the borderPoint function, it is now: (r, Rbook, distance, plotting). Extends its application: Generates the spectral information of the edge of the UEs for analysis of the border effect, it requires the spectral image, the distance of the border and the segmentation of the UEs generated by imageField.
- Changes to the arguments in the fixedPoint function. segments by npoints and length by long, the output contains the coordinates of the ends of the generated segments.
- Modification of arguments in the imageField function, it is now: (r, Q, ny, nx, dy, dx, start=1,  plotting=TRUE, ...), ny by nPl, nx by nPw, dy by long, dx by wide and plotting by ploting.
- The examples were edited.

Version rPAex 1.0.1 (January 18, 2020)
-------------------------------------------

- New movePlot() function:  Rotation and Translation of the Plot Position.
- Added in the output the parameters of the imageField() function is now a list with parameters and Qbase (data frame image)
- In the "inst" path, 3 divisions were determined: 1-examples (procedures in R), 2-external (data) and 3-script (complementary functions of the package)
- The examples were edited.
