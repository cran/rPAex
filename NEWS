Changes in new version

Version rPAex 1.0.5 (November 01, 2023)
-------------------------------------------
- The examples were edited. Error in x11(): screen devices should not be used in examples. 

Version rPAex 1.0.4 (October 22, 2023)
-------------------------------------------
- The rPAex package updated the functions affected by the "raster" package. It is now updated to the "terra" package with the same results for all functions. The parameters of each function are maintained.
- Change of name of the dataset _evolution_ to _cropTime_ corresponds to the images of the crop in all its growth.

Version rPAex 1.0.3 (March 31, 2023)
-------------------------------------------
- EUsPoint() function:  The Matrix Q was updated (Coordinates of the vertices of a particular experimental unit). The name of the "unit" argument changed to "EU".
- movePlot() function: change in example.
- Image data of the cassava crop was added. Two data tables, the data(evolution) that contains 9 images of the third plot in a period of 10 months of 38 flights, and the image of the crop data(cassava) that contains the complete image of the 11 flight. The data corresponds to Images from the public repository of the International Potato Center, where the multispectral spectrum data was extracted, to facilitate the execution of the rPAex package article under development.

Version rPAex 1.0.2 (August 20, 2022)
-------------------------------------------
- New EUsPoint() function:  Generates the matrix Q (Coordinates of the vertices of a particular experimental unit)
- Remove of the externalPoint() function,
- Modification of arguments in the borderPoint function, it is now: (r, Rbook, distance, plotting). Extends its application: Generates the spectral information of the edge of the UEs for analysis of the border effect, it requires the spectral image, the distance of the border and the segmentation of the UEs generated by imageField.
- Changes to the arguments in the fixedPoint function. segments by npoints and length by long, the output contains the coordinates of the ends of the generated segments.
- Modification of arguments in the imageField function, it is now: (r, Q, ny, nx, dy, dx, start=1,  plotting=TRUE, ...), ny by nPl, nx by nPw, dy by long, dx by wide and plotting by ploting.
- The examples were edited.

Version rPAex 1.0.1 (January 18, 2020)
-------------------------------------------

- New movePlot() function:  Rotation and Translation of the Plot Position.
- Added in the output the parameters of the imageField() function is now a list with parameters and Qbase (data frame image)
- In the "inst" path, 3 divisions were determined: 1-examples (procedures in R), 2-external (data) and 3-script (complementary functions of the package)
- The examples were edited.
