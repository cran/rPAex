\section{Changes in version 1.0.5 (2023-11-01)}{
  \itemize{
    \item The examples were edited. The examples were edited. Error in x11(): screen devices should not be used in examples.
}
}

\section{Changes in version 1.0.4 (2023-10-22)}{
  \itemize{
    \item The rPAex package updated the functions affected by the "raster" package. It is now updated to the "terra" package with the same results for all functions. The parameters of each function are maintained.
  \item Change of name of the dataset _evolution_ to _cropTime_ corresponds to the images of the crop in all its growth.
}
}

\section{Changes in version 1.0.3 (2023-03-31)}{
  \subsection{Modify function}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{EUsPoint} The Matrix Q was updated (Coordinates of the vertices of a particular experimental unit). The name of the "unit" argument changed to "EU".  
      \item \code{movePlot} change in example.}
      }
  \subsection{New data}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{cassava} crop that contains the complete image of flight 11
      \item \code{evolution} contains 9 images of 38 flights of a plot in a period of 10 months corresponding to the third plot of the cassava crop.} 
   } 
}
\section{Changes in version 1.0.2 (2022-08-20)}{
  \subsection{New function}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{EUsPoint} Generates the matrix Q (Coordinates of the vertices of a particular experimental unit).}  }

  \subsection{Update parameters}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{borderPoint} new arguments (r, Rbook, distance, plotting). Extends its application: Generates the spectral information of the edge of the experimental units for the analysis of the edge effect, it requires the spectral image, the edge distance and the segmentation of the units generated by imageField.
      \item \code{fixedPoint} change segments=npoints,length=long
      \item \code{imageField} changes Q=P,ny=nPl,ny=nPw, dy=long, dx=wide
      \item \code{imageField} add parameter: start=1
      }
   }

  \subsection{New output}{
    \itemize{
      \item Added in the output the parameters of the imageField(), coordinates.unit, new argument for the limits of each experimental unit.
    }
  }  
  \subsection{Removed}{
    \itemize{
      \item ExternalPoint, its functionality is included in the EUsPoint function.
    }
 }
}

\section{Changes in version 1.0.1 (2020-01-18)}{
  \subsection{New function}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{movePlot} Rotation and Translation of the Plot Position.}  }

  \subsection{New output}{
    \itemize{
      \item Added in the output the parameters of the imageField() function is now a list with parameters and Qbase (data frame image).
    }
  }  
 
 \subsection{Tweaks}{
    \itemize{
      \item Examples (procedures in R). 
      \item External (data). 
      \item Script (complementary functions of the package).
    }
 }

 \subsection{Bug Fixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item The examples were edited.
    }
 }
